# 🍽️ Restuarant_Sentiment_Analysis

This project aims to classify restaurant reviews as **positive** or **negative** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. It's a basic sentiment analysis task built using Python and scikit-learn.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `Restaurant review Classification.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with all the code: data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

## 📊 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Numpy
- NLTK (for text cleaning)
- Scikit-learn (CountVectorizer, Naive Bayes, etc.)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (optional for visualizations)

## 🔍 Dataset

The dataset contains restaurant reviews with binary sentiment labels:  
- **1** = Positive  
- **0** = Negative

Make sure the dataset is present or follow the instructions in the notebook to load it properly.

## ⚙️ Features

- Text Cleaning (stopword removal, stemming, punctuation removal)
- Feature Extraction using CountVectorizer
- Model Training using Naive Bayes
- Sentiment Prediction on custom reviews
- Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, and Evaluation Report

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/restaurant-review-classification.git
   cd restaurant-review-classification
